  hello.du -- a maximum effort "hello world"

  This prints a verbose but nice hello using the flexible
  multi-line strings and markdown -> ansi from our stdlib.

  For added fun we check the system environment to see if
  the user has $NOCOLOR set so we skip making pretty ANSI.

  # Hello Brave Explorer

  **Welcome!** I am humbled by your willingness to give this new thing a try. I've worked very hard to make `duso` a simple and powerful language that's easy for humans and LLMs to use and understand.

  I hope this is the start of something great for you.

  **Happy scripting!**
