# Duso Community

## Our Values ☝️

- **Respectful Participation: ** We listen to each other. Disagreement is fine. Rudeness isn't. Everyone deserves respect regardless of their level of expertise.
- **Transparent Process: ** We make decisions openly. When we say "no" to something, we explain why. When we make a change that affects you, we're honest about it.
- **Simplicity Over Cleverness:** We optimize for readability and practicality, not for showing off. A straightforward approach that works is better than an elegant one that confuses people. 
- **Agentic Code:** Duso was written as a collaboration between human and LLM. Your AI-written code is welcome, but may not be accepted. Please try one thing at a time, don't flood us with PRs. ✨

## Community Guidelines

🤗 Be kind. 🤓 Be honest. 🤔 Be constructive.

- **Respect each other's time.** Maintainers are volunteers. We'll do our best to respond, but sometimes that takes time.
- **Assume good intent.** Someone's idea might not work for Duso, but that doesn't mean it's a bad idea or they're wrong.
- **Give context.** When reporting an issue or suggesting a feature, help us understand the real problem you're trying to solve.
- **No unsolicited promotion.** We welcome you sharing what you've built, but spam doesn't belong here.
- **Help, don't gatekeep.** If you know something, help newcomers. Being a beginner isn't a character flaw.

## What Maintainers Commit To

- We'll review PRs thoughtfully and give feedback
- We won't merge code we don't understand or believe in
- We'll be honest if something isn't a good fit for Duso
- We'll keep the project stable and maintained
- We'll explain our decisions when they affect the community
- We won't ghost issues or pretend feedback doesn't matter

## What We Won't Tolerate

Rudeness, dismissal, or attacks on people. If you see it, report it to a maintainer. We take that seriously.
